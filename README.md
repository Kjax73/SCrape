# SCrape
SCrape is a tool built to join all available raffles on scrap.tf, pretty simple.

# Warning
Obviously against the raffle rules, not my fault if you get banned

# Features
To my knowledge of looking a other scripts, I beleive currently mine is the only one that has capthca detection, therefore it will work 100% more than the others I have looked at.
Will join all raffles as quickly as your internet/computer will allow.
Automatically detects and alerts of captchas(Windows only for alert sound).
Relatively undetectable(untested lol, but I haven't been banned yet).

# Requirements
Chrome.
Python 2.7 w/ Selenium.
Windows, if you want the alert sound to work.
Half a brain.

# Setup
1. Download Chrome and Chromedriver
2. Launch Chrome and login to scrap.tf through steam once
3. Locate your cookie data in your settings
4. Input the content of the corresponding cookies into the program code(Its labeled in my code as the cookies section)
5. Define your path to chromeriver at the top of the code
Complete
